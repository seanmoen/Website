    <h1>Projects</h1>
    Here are some projects I have done over the years.

    <section>
    <h2>Personal</h2>

    <a href="https://seannotseen.com">
        <h3>seannotseen.com</h3>
    </a>

    <p>
        This is the website you are on! Ever since I took my Computer Networks class, I have wanted to create a website.
        I like the challenge of figuring out the right configurations and I wanted to challenge myself by not using a hosting platform.
        This website is ran on a Raspberry Pi on my home internet.
        I use Dynamic DNS to constanly update my current IP as I do not have a static IP.
        (I hope Google's Dynamic DNS service is still active for a while.)
        This Raspberry Pi also hosts a Minecraft server.
        Also, having a computer I can ssh to from anywhere makes me feel cool.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://seannotseen.com">seannotseen.com</a> name comes from a recurring phenomomenon I experienced growing up.
        People have always called me "Seen" after seing how my name is spelled.
        I am used to it now and I figured that would be the best name for a personal website.
        It also confuses people when I tell them to go to my website.
        I have discovered that it is hard to casually bring up you have a website in a normal conversation.

    <h2>Hackathons</h2>

    <p>
        I have competed at various Hackathons over my college career.
        It is where I have learned to fear the infamous "git merge" command.
        Take a look at the projects and prizes!

        <h3>Tigerhacks 2023</h3>
    </a>

    <h4>Project</h4>

    <p>
        We created a website called Social Duel.
        The idea was to create challenges that people could complete in the real world to compete for prizes.
        We created a website to showcase this.
        We used the Electron framework which allowed our React code to be ran in a website, a native desktop app, and on mobile apps.
        We used Google Cloud for hosting, Auth0 for user authentication, React for the frontend, Node for the backend, and MongoDB as a databse.
    </p>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/seanmoen/tiger-hacks-2023">
    <h4>My Contribution</h4>
    </a>
        
    <p>
        I helped create the frontend and configure our server. This was my first project using React.
        I created our MongoDB Atllas cluster to save our data and access the backend.
        In addition, I used my skills with Apache to make our Google Cloud Instance become a web server.
        In fact, <a href="seannotseen.com">seannotseen.com</a> became our test server for a bit.
    </p>
    <h4>Prizes</h4>

    <p>
        We won the "Best Use of Auth0" prize for our project.
    </p>

    <h3>PickHacks 2023</h3>
    </a>
    <h4>Project</h4>

        <p>
        My team created a Gas Station Locator.
        This project would send users a SMS message to alert them of the nearest Eco-Friendly Gas Station.
        We used the Twilio API to send the SMS message and the Google Maps API to gather a list of gas stations.
        </p>

    <a href="https://github.com/seanmoen/pickhacks2023">
    <h4>My Contribution</h4>
    </a>
    
    <p>
        I was in charge of the Google Maps API integration.
        I used the Python API to receive a JSON with all the nearby gas stations.
        This list was used to lookup the most EcoFriendly gas station based on the parent company's ESG score.
        The ESG score describes how environmentally friendly a company is and a higher score is better.
    </p>

    <h4>Prizes</h4>

    <p>
        We won the "Most Creative Use of Twilio" prize for our project.
